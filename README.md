## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers. Follow the steps below:

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will start the frontend server. You can access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

Open another terminal window to start the backend server.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will start the backend server. It will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

Now, both frontend and backend servers are running concurrently, and you can interact with the application.
